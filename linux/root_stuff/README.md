# Root stuff
## *.desktop stuff
1. Go to Menue (Application Bar) » Preferences » Main Menue Editor
   - choose System Tools (or any other where you want to display the app)
   - Click New Item
   - Give it a (senselessy :P) name
   - and a senslessy description.
   - type in a command. Here are some useful commands
     - `sudo pcmanfm %U` to run the File Manager as root or
     - `sudo su` and tick `Run in console`
     - `sudo nano [or leafpad, ...] /path/to/a/file_u_often_edit.txt` (e.g: /boot/config.txt)

You can show a desktop file in the Application bar if you right clicking it » Application Launch Bar Settings and choose the one you want to display. Maybe it's in the 'Others' folder if you've created it.
