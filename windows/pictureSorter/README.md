# Picture sorter
Sorts pictures by its exif-data
## Installation
Download any (newest recomended) version:
- German [BATCH](s-PS_DE_BATCH) | ~~[EXEcutable](s-PS_DE_EXE)~~ (comming soon...)
- English ~~[BATCH](s-PS_GB_BATCH)~~ | ~~[EXEcutable](s-PS_EN_EXE)~~ (comming soon...)

and save it anywhere on your hard disk (or usb stick, ...)

The Executables are generated by [Bat2Exe converter](http://www.f2ko.de/en/b2e.php).
## Manual
Put the images in the INPUT-Folder, start the converter select, how you want the files to be sorted, wait, (dont touch the tmp-Folder :P) and get the sorted images from the output folder.
Dont forget to remove the images from the INPUT and OUTPUT-Folder
## How it works
The images in the INPUT folder wont be modified at all. The batch copy them to tmp, read the exif data of each image and write them how you configured it. After that, it moves them to the OUTPUT-Folder

To read the exif-datas, the batch uses [exiftool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) by Phil Harvey.
